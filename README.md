## Introduction
From time to time I see posts on r/sysadmin asking what "What are your daily tools" or "What are some of your favorite tools" or "What is on your USB toolkit".

The way I keep track of my favorite Apps/Scripts/Tools is by using my personal and work OneDrive. I do this by creating a Apps, Scripts and Tools folder in the root of my OneDrive.
Then inside of each of these folders, I create folders for each item. Inside each item's folder, I create a shortcut to their website and usually save the most recent version.
There are teo main problems with this approach.

1. Keeping my personal and work OneDrives synced between each other.

2. If I were to get a new job I have to make sure to export everything but I do not like logging in to my personal account on my work device and I dont like logging in to my work account on my persoanl device. 

Seeing these kind of posts got me thinking to make a single repository.
